# Document processing with Azure Form Recognizer

## What is Form Recognizer?
Form Recognizer is an AI service that applies advanced machine learning to extract text, key-value pairs, tables, and structures from documents automatically and accurately. Turn documents into usable data and shift your focus to acting on information rather than compiling it.

### The following are the main topics covered in this lab:
1. Extract text, tables, structure, key-value pairs, and named entities from documents using the following document analysis models:
    1. Read OCR
    2. Layout analysis
    3. General document
2. Extract data from unique document types using the following prebuilt models:
    1. W-2
    2. Invoice
    3. Receipt
    4. Identity document (ID)
    5. Business card
3. Extract text, structure, and fields from models trained with your data, so they're tailored to your forms and documents using the following custom models:
    1. Template (Custom form) models
    2. Neural (Custom document) models
